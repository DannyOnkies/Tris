The game of tic-tac-toe
_______________________

Tic-tac-toe is a hugely popular abstract paper and pencil game with perfect information. It is played on a 3 Ã— 3 square grid. In turn, the players choose an empty cell and draw their symbol in it. The player who manages to arrange three of their symbols in a straight horizontal, vertical or diagonal line wins. If the grid is filled without either player completing a straight line of three symbols, the game ends in a draw.
